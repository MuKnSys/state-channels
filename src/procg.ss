;; Proc groups
;; =>
;;   proc groups have proc UIDs ; but we dispatch on them only locally, at the moment ;
;;   proc groups can receive and send messages, but they are virtual ; so, that requires consensus ;
;;   procs can belong to only one group (for state-channel-replicated procs, seems that it can't be otherwise) ;
;;
;; NOTE: proc groups should become actual processes in the future ; the group is then the mapping of the group's
;;       core in the local mem of one member. The group, since it is a process, can act as the master of the
;;       interaction (e.g. in RSM) ; in case it is more trusted than the members, it's a win ; otherwise, we
;;       can still use the turning master algorithm, and the members manage the turntaking in between themselves.
;;       The group-as-process is still necessary to get initial information about the group. Finally, only empty
;;       servlets can join a group ; they post a join to the current master, which makes it be multisigned, and
;;       then downloads the current version of the shared state to the newly entering member.
;;       
;;       2 cases:
;;       => cooperative mode: in that case, nothing prevents the group master to fulfill all the functions
;;                            pertaining to a master, i.e., initial connection, join/leave, and turntaking
;;                            management (aka. consensus) ;
;;       => adversarial/byzantine mode: in that situation, the group's member can in fact fulfill all the
;;                            functions, including join/leave ; the initial connection is somehow problematic,
;;                            in case the group starts from one member, who happens to be rogue ; for this, its
;;                            behaviour has to be constrained enough by the protocol to prevent useful exploitation
;;                            of the initial connection mechanism ; probably starting from an initial snapshot of
;;                            the group's master _and_ of the group's participant process provides a strong enough
;;                            starting point for a design (this is also valid for a restart after migration) ; there
;;                            are hybrid cases, e.g. the case of a contract in the chain driving a state channel is
;;                            a case where the master is trusted, and where the participants are not ;
